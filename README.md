# COVID-Protection
The purpose of this app is to inform people of how important it is to wear a mask during this Coronavirus pandemic. 

This app will give you updates on the stats of how many deaths have occurred in the United States since this pandemic began. It also renders youtube videos with CDC information about COVID-19. Lastly, my app renders a variety of masks that are on sale from the Esty website and a link at the bottom for users to go to Esty to purchase a mask.
